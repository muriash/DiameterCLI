# DiameterCLI
DiameterCLI is a Python-based application designed to simulate NB-IoT device communication with a Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) using the Diameter protocol over SCTP transport. This tool helps developers and researchers test and analyze the behavior of SCEF without the need for real IoT hardware.
